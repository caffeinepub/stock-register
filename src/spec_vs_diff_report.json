  "summary": "REQ-13/14/15 appear implemented via a new LoginScreen, top-level gating in App.tsx based on identity/initialization, and a logout handler in StockRegisterPage. REQ-16 is partially addressed by adding permission checks to write methods, but the backend implementation introduces broader role/access-control machinery beyond anonymous-only rejection and adds other unrequested authorization-gated APIs.",
  "missing_requirements": [],
  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Introduced role-based access control (admin/user permissions) and authorization mixin/state beyond basic authenticated-vs-anonymous gating.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly disallows role-based access control beyond basic authenticated vs anonymous gating; diff adds AccessControl, permissions, and admin checks.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added new backend user profile APIs with authorization checks (getCallerUserProfile, getUserProfile, saveCallerUserProfile).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest only requested restricting stock write operations for anonymous callers; user profile management was not requested.",
      "evidence": [
        "backend/main.mo"
      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Backend write operations now require a '#user' permission rather than only rejecting anonymous principals.",
      "reason": "REQ-16 requires rejecting anonymous callers; the diff enforces a stronger permission model (hasPermission(..., #user)) that may reject authenticated callers lacking that permission, which is beyond the stated requirement.",

        "backend/main.mo"

    {
      "description": "Modified an immutable-path authentication hook file (useActor.ts) and added admin-token initialization behavior.",
      "reason": "Constraints say not to modify files in frontend/immutablePaths (explicitly including frontend/src/hooks/useActor.ts). The diff modifies it and adds logic to read a secret token and call _initializeAccessControlWithSecret.",

      ]
    },
    {
      "description": "Added URL parameter/sessionStorage utilities (urlParams.ts), including handling of a 'caffeineAdminToken'.",

      "description": "Added a 'caffeine.ai' promotional footer/link and non-English/emoji heart in the Login screen footer text.",

    },
    {
